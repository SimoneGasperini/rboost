Photonics is the technology of photons (as electronics is the technology of electrons)
and promises to be the new century's driving force in the advancement of, mainly but 
not only, communications and computing, the information technology. This technology was initiated 
with the advent of lasers and optical fibers which, for various reasons, embody the best choice
of source and channel of the information carrier: the photon. Many more components are needed
not only in the transport section of the technology but also, and principally, in the logic section: 
signal processing. An answer is needed to many of these demands by the potentiality of the 
new photonics era: the photonic band gap (PBG) materials, otherwise known as photonic crystals (PC). 
In the present article a general perspective is presented on the state of the art 
in photonic crystals technology providing a broad audience-oriented description of fundamentals 
and properties and centring in self-assembly. SEE FIGURE "photonic_crystals_review".

Planar photonic crystals consist of 100 nanometer sized arrays of holes etched in a planar 
semiconductor waveguide. These structures allow the control of the electromagnetic field 
at the wavelength scale. These structures can be designed in a way that a resonant optical field 
extends mainly outside of the dielectric medium and can be used to optically trap particles. 
A very strong feedback action of the trapped particle on the resonant trapping field is observed 
and gives rise to very specific physical properties of the optical trap. The present and future 
activities of the group in this field cover concern a wide spectrum of topics from the trapping of 
particles in vacuum to applications in biophotonics involving optical trapping of viruses or 
bacteria and their interaction with e.g. antibiotics or bacteriophages.
