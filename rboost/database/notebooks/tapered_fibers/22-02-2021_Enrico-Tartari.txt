Tapered fiber preparation with micropipette puller instrument:

Parameters that will be varied: heat, pull, delay

Heat: from 300 to 400 SEE FIGURE "heat"
300: 0.35
400: 0.17

Pull: from 120 to 200
120: 1.12
200: 0.89

Delay: from 100 to 150
100: 0.54
200: 0.44

From these trial we found out that the best combination of parameters to obtain 0.6 microns of
tapered fiber tip dimensions is:
Heat(350) Pull(150) Delay (100) SEE FIGURE "best"

The protocol of fabrication is totally repeatable.

Tomorrow we will try to add the parameter "velocity" to see if something changes.

The idea will be to produce a thin enough taperede fiber to get a intense enough evanescent field at the
tip of the fiber to be able to couple it with the single photon source dipole radiation. 

Then we will try to implement the fiber to our setup and we will be able to move the fiber over the sample 
using a piezoelectric stage. This will be fundamental to optimize the coupling both in excitation and 
detection mode. An idea of the setup could be this one: SEE FIGURE "setup".

Shape of the fibers tip obtained by varying the heat parameter and keeping fixed
the others. The best shape is obtained using a value of the parameter of 350.

-best.tif
Shape of the fibers tip obtained by varying the velocity and pulling parameters
while choosing the best parameters value we found for the others. The best
shapes are obtained using a value of the pulling parameter of 150 and 18 for the
velocity or 200 and 18

Here the internal arrangement of the components in the cryostat is shown. The
piezoelectric on the left supports the tapered nanofiber. The piezoelectric closest
to the reader supports the objective. The sample is the stage farthest from the
reader.
