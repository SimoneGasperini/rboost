Tapered fiber preparation with micropipette puller instrument:

Parameters that will be varied: heat, pull, delay

Heat: from 300 to 400 SEE FIGURE "heat"
300: 0.35
400: 0.17

Pull: from 120 to 200
120: 1.12
200: 0.89

Delay: from 100 to 150
100: 0.54
200: 0.44

From these trial we found out that the best combination of parameters to obtain 0.6 microns of
tapered fiber tip dimensions is:
Heat(350) Pull(150) Delay (100) SEE FIGURE "best"

The protocol of fabrication is totally repeatable.
Tomorrow we will try to add the parameter "velocity" to see if something changes.

-heat.tif
Shape of the fibers tip obtained by varying the heat parameter and keeping fixed
the others. The best shape is obtained using a value of the parameter of 350.

-best.tif
Shape of the fibers tip obtained by varying the velocity and pulling parameters
while choosing the best parameters value we found for the others. The best
shapes are obtained using a value of the pulling parameter of 150 and 18 for the
velocity or 200 and 18.
