The idea is to produce a thin enough taperede fiber to get a intense enough evanescent field at the
tip of the fiber to be able to couple it with the single photon source dipole radiation. 

Then we try to implement the fiber to our setup and we will be able to move the fiber over the sample 
using a piezoelectric stage. This is fundamental to optimize the coupling both in excitation and 
detection mode. An idea of the setup could be this one: SEE FIGURE "setup".

Here the internal arrangement of the components in the cryostat is shown. The
piezoelectric on the left supports the tapered nanofiber. The piezoelectric closest
to the reader supports the objective. The sample is the stage farthest from the
reader.
