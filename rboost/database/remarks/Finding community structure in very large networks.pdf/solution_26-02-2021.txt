While finding the global maximum modularity over all possible divisions seems hard in general, reasonably good solutions
can be found with approximate optimization techniques.
One possible method is based on greedy optimization in which, starting with each vertex being the sole member of a
community of one, we repeatedly join together the two communities whose amalgamation produces the largest increase in Q.
For a network of n vertices, after nâˆ’1 such joins we are left with a single community and the algorithm stops.
The entire process can be represented as a tree whose leaves are the vertices of the original network and whose internal
nodes correspond to the joins.
