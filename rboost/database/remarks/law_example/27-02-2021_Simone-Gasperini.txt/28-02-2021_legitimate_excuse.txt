Although not part of the defense's team of experts, an authority on the forensic use, P. Gill, publicly said that the
case against Knox and Sollecito was misconceived because they had a legitimate excuse for their DNA being present on
Sollecito's kitchen knife, and in the crime scene apartment. According to Gill, the DNA fragment from Sollecito on
the bra clasp could have got there through Sollecito having touched the handle of Kercher's door while trying to force
it, enabling transfer of his DNA to the bra clasp inside the bedroom on the latex gloves used by investigators.
